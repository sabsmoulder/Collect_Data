# Collecting Data Assignment 1 


I have added Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens as an ebook from gutenberg.org. Oliver Twist is about an orphan boy who escaped his orphanage and went to London where he faces with challenges. This is one of my favourite books because it teaches a lot of things such as, being sympathetic to others, greatfulness and bravery.
